Hello! This project has been made by students from the Game Dev Club at San Francisco State University: Charlie, Emerson, and Michael.
This is our submission to the Supercell AI Game Hack 2026!

This is our first time developing a game with AI tools, and its been a fascinating learning experience.

Included in this repo is the source code to the game as exported from Rosebud AI (should be WebGL). However, if that does not run properly for your system, included in this readme is the link to the game page on Rosebud AI.

P.S. we ran out of credits in the middle of development and so we made another account and used the promo code again in order to remix our own game. This is why some naming might not line up and why it will have the remix labels and all.
